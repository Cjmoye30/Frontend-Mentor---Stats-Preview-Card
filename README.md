## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Some syntax I learned which was new to me was being able to adjust the opacity of the image you imported. I was then able to set a color for the backgroundand have that show through.

```css
.col2 {
  opacity: .5;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to focus on developing my knowledge of the grid system, and best practices for small projects like these.
